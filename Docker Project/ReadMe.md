This application runs a live website with real-time visitor tracking.

By using:
<br>
- **Flask** framework for the webserver
- **Redis** database for website visitor tracking
- **Docker** platform to containerise and run the isolated applications
<br>
The combination of these technologies allows for the production and deployment of code to run a website that performs and provides live information!
<br><br>
Some of the challenges I faced are:
<br>

- Writing and understanding code for Flask webserver and Redis database
- Understanding Docker images

Some features I REALLY want to implement in the near future are:

- Producing Volumes that persist data, so visit counter is not reset upon container restarts
- Adding great looking display through HTML/CSS to make the website vibrant
- Deploying NGINX webservers and load balancing traffic
- Additional security features like passwords to database
